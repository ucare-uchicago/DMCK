# DMCK Initial Timeout (ms)
#   In the beginning or when a node just restarted,

#   its state if no event is enabled.

# DMCK Events Queueing Handling
#   If this is true, then DMCK will assume that the target system
#   uses TCP paradigm which also means that the DMCK will not queue
#   more than 1 message from node A to node B to the DMCK Queue.
#   Otherwise, DMCK allows more than 2 messages from node A to node B
#   in DMCK queue.
